# avg

This program will calculate your average grade.

### Commands

* First, create the executable file with the "make" command.
* The program must be run as follows:
  ```
  ./avg [number_of_grade]
  ```
  
### Description

* For each grade, the program asks for its "label" (subject), and its "coef" (coefficient, percentage).
* The program can handle float numbers.
* If the grade is a float number, a dot must be used instead of a coma.
* The grades and the labels can be modified after being entered.
